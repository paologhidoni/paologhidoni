# Hello World, I am Paolo!

I am an aspiring Web Developer who enjoys *each and every new challenge*. 

My experience with coding so far includes building 3 startup landing pages and joining coding bootcamp [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com) in London; I am currently part of September 2021 cohort. 

My favorite technologies to work with are HTML, CSS, Sass and JavaScript. I strive to learn something new every day; my goal for 2021 - 2022 is to learn React.js and Node.js.

My core goals are:

* Working on meaningful projects. 
* Cooperating with passionate and committed people.
* Building products that users can benefit from.
* Constantly grow and improve as a human being and as a developer.
